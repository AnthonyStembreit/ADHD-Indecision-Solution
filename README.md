## User Story

As a person wtih ADHD who struggles with indecision,

I want an application that saves my favorite activites and randomly generates one for me to do,

So that I do not waste time being indecisive and have more time to have fun!

## Description
Users create a list of activites which is saved in local storage, the user can then go to the generate page to be presented with a random activity from their list. If they do not want to do the activity that is generated they can generate a new activity. The user can also exclude activities from the list temporarily; for example if one activity is a picnic outside and it is raining the user can simply uncheck the box next to that activity to exclude it. The user can also view their saved list and delete any activities that no longer instrests them.
